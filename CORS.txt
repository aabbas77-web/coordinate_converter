? Option 1: Using venv (recommended for quick local testing)
Step 1: Create a new virtual environment
Open your terminal / PowerShell and run:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv myenv
This creates a folder called myenv containing a clean Python installation.

Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
myenv\Scripts\activate
On macOS / Linux:

bash
Copy code
source myenv/bin/activate
You should see your prompt change to something like:

scss
Copy code
(myenv) C:\Users\you\project>
Step 3: Upgrade pip (optional but recommended)
bash
Copy code
pip install --upgrade pip
Step 4: Install your project requirements
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 5: Run your Python code
Now you can run your script (e.g.):

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The code runs inside this clean environment, completely separate from your system Python.

Step 6: Deactivate when done
bash
Copy code
deactivate
